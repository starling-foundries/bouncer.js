# bouncer.js

## Use and Maintenance note:

This bouncer is neither the official nor maintained version. At present insurmountable challenges with using the official js-sdk have prevented me from even running the readme-embedded 'quickstart' code. For now this *nonfunctional* repo will serve as a record of what needs to be addressed. 

A simple, generic node-based metatransactions bouncer intended to embed in a service mesh or offer as a standalone microservice perhaps behind a proxy. This bouncer implements only basic functionality like RPC relays, whitelists and a redis-backed mempool.
